# NLP with Disaster Tweets
This repository contains our solution for the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to build a machine learning model that can predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.

## Competition Description
In this competition, we're challenged to create a model that distinguishes between tweets about real disasters and irrelevant tweets. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that have been hand-labeled. Our task is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a predictive model.

## Dataset
- **Training Data**: 10,000 labeled tweets that indicate whether the tweet is about a real disaster (`1`) or not (`0`).
- **Test Data**: Tweets for which we need to predict the labels.

## Running the Code 
To run the code, simply open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the button below, or in [LuaLuaLua.ipynb](LuaLuaLua.ipynb):
